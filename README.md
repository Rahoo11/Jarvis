# Introduction

Jarvis is my own virtual assistant, designed to work on any device.

# Usage

Run the file named according to the system you are on. Currently supported systems are:

- Windows
- Android
- Raspian (Linux)

# Developers

There are 2 main ways to improve Jarvis:

## Adding support for new systems

If you want to run Jarvis on a system not yet supported, you can write a file following the guidance in `Design.md`, the template `TemplateSystem.py` and the existing ones as examples, e.g.: `Windows.py`.

## Improving the core

At the moment, Jarvis is hard-coded but I intend to add machine learning ability.
